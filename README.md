# Tanks
## It's gonna ruin friendships

Tanks is a multiplayer game that runs on a web app built with Node.js. The objective of the game is to be the last player standing, but the mechanics of the game make it very difficult to win without forming alliances with other players.

### Gameplay 
Each player starts on a grid in a random position. Each player has one action per day, which they can spend on shooting another player, moving to a different location on the grid, or giving their action to another player.

### Winning
The player that survives until the end is the winner. However, the game is designed to encourage players to backstab and betray one another, making it a thrilling and unpredictable experience.
